Classic song form:
Intro:
 V V V V
Verse:
 IV V I IV
 IV V IV V
Chorus:
 I IV [V IV] [IV V]
Bridge:
 IV IV I I
 IV IV I V

- Chord I was only used 3 times. And once during the verses. When it arrives in chorus, it's powerful and satisfying. ~ Can we say the same for V?
- The 1/2 change at the end of the chorus created extra motion
- Bridge centers around IV for contrast
- V at the end of the bridge makes an easy lead back to the verse or chorus

Turn arounds: rhythmi urgency of turnarounds at slower speeds is weaker
